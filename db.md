Django supports a variety of **databases**, both officially and unofficially. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the most common options you can use with Django:

---

### ‚úÖ **Officially Supported Databases**

These are tested and supported out of the box by Django.

1. **PostgreSQL** (recommended)

   * ‚úÖ Most feature-rich (full-text search, JSON fields, GIS, etc.)
   * üîí Strong data integrity and scalability
   * üî• Best choice for production
   * `ENGINE = 'django.db.backends.postgresql'`

2. **MySQL**

   * ‚úÖ Widely used, especially for legacy systems
   * ‚ö†Ô∏è Some features (like strict constraints) require configuration
   * `ENGINE = 'django.db.backends.mysql'`

3. **SQLite**

   * ‚úÖ Lightweight, file-based (great for development or small apps)
   * ‚ùå Not suitable for high-concurrency production use
   * `ENGINE = 'django.db.backends.sqlite3'`

4. **Oracle**

   * üè¢ Used mostly in enterprise environments
   * ‚ùó Heavier setup and licensing
   * `ENGINE = 'django.db.backends.oracle'`

---

### ‚úÖ **Third-Party / Community Supported Databases**

These need third-party backends or adapters:

1. **Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)**

   * Requires `django-mssql-backend` or similar
   * Used in enterprise environments

2. **MongoDB** (NoSQL)

   * Django is SQL-based, but can be used with MongoDB via:

     * `djongo` (bridge for MongoDB with SQL syntax)
     * `mongoengine` (ODM; replaces Django ORM)

3. **Redis**

   * Not a primary database, but used for:

     * Caching
     * Session storage
     * Queues and tokens (like password reset)

4. **CockroachDB**

   * Distributed SQL database (PostgreSQL-compatible)
   * Can work with Django via Postgres backend

5. **Amazon Aurora**

   * Managed DB service (MySQL/Postgres compatible)
   * Use respective backend engine

### üîÅ Example Database Config in `settings.py` for PostgreSQL:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'your_db_name',
        'USER': 'your_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

---

### üîç Recommendation:

* **Use PostgreSQL** for production projects.
* **Use SQLite** for local development or testing.
* **Use Redis** for caching and background tasks, not as your main DB.

For a **job portal platform** (where professionals post job opportunities and students apply), you'll need a **reliable, scalable, and relational database** that supports:

* Complex queries (e.g. filtering jobs by field or location)
* Many-to-many relationships (e.g. students applying to multiple jobs, jobs having many applicants)
* Data integrity (e.g. foreign key constraints between users and job applications)
* Optional full-text search or filtering

### ‚úÖ Best Database for This Use Case: **PostgreSQL**

#### Why PostgreSQL is ideal:

* üöÄ **Great performance** with large datasets
* üîç **Advanced querying**, including full-text search (good for filtering job titles/descriptions)
* üîê **Strong data integrity**
* üß© **Support for JSON fields** (helpful if you want to store flexible job metadata)
* üó∫Ô∏è **PostGIS** support if you want geolocation filtering in the future

### üõ† Example Django `settings.py` config for PostgreSQL:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'job_portal_db',
        'USER': 'your_db_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',  # Or your cloud DB host
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

---

### üß± Key Models You‚Äôll Likely Need:

* `User` (Student / Professional with roles)
* `JobPosting` (title, company, description, etc.)
* `Application` (job, applicant, resume, status)
* Possibly `Company` and `StudentProfile`

---

### üîÅ Bonus Add-ons:

* Use **Redis** for:

  * Caching job lists
  * Handling async tasks (e.g. sending emails)
* Use **Celery** + **Redis** for background processing
